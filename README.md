## Java* Native Interface binding for Intel® QuickAssist Technology
Qat-Java library provides accelerated compression and decompression using Intel® QuickAssist Technology (QAT) [QATzip](https://github.com/intel/QATzip) library. For more information about Intel® QAT, refer to the [QAT Programmer's Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/743912/intel-quickassist-technology-intel-qat-software-for-linux-programmers-guide-hardware-version-2-0.html). Additionally, the online [QAT Hardware User Guide](https://intel.github.io/quickassist/index.html) is a valuable resource that provides guidance on setting up and optimizing Intel® QAT.

Qat-Java currently supports DEFLATE and LZ4 compression algorithms.

## Prerequisite
To use Intel® QAT for compression and decompression, Qat-Java requires the following dependencies to be met.

1. **QAT driver** &mdash; download the Intel® QAT driver for Linux from [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/765501/intel-quickassist-technology-driver-for-linux-hw-version-2-0.html) and then follow these [installation instructions](https://intel.github.io/quickassist/GSG/2.X/index.html).

2. **QATZip** &mdash; the installation instructions for the QATZip library are available at [github.com/intel/QATZip#installation-instructions](https://github.com/intel/QATzip#installation-instructions).

In cases where a QAT hardware is not available, Qat-Java can use a software-only execution mode. The instructions for installing and configuring the dependencies for a software-only execution mode are documented [here](SOFTWARE_ONLY_CONFIG.md).

## Build
In addition to the prerequisites listed above, building Qat-Java requires the following to be installed:

* Java 11 or above.
* gcc, CMake , Maven, and clang (for fuzz testing).

To build qat-java, run the below command:
```
mvn clean package
```

Other Maven targets include:

- `compile` &mdash; builds sources.
- `test` &mdash; builds and runs tests.
- `package` &mdash; builds and writes jar files into ```target``` directory.
- `javadoc:javadoc` &mdash; generates javadocs. 
- `spotless:check` &mdash; check if source code is formatted well.
- `spotless:apply` &mdash; fixes source code format issues.
- `site` &mdash; generates Surefire reports into ```target/site```.

> The build instructions were tested using gcc-8.5.0, cmake-3.10.0, mvn-3.5.4 and clang-16.0.0.

## Testing
To run all the unit tests, execute the below command.
```
mvn clean test
```

To include hardware specific tests, execute the below command:
```
mvn clean test -Dhardware.available=true
```

You can also install the [Jazzer](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) tool and run Fuzz tests. 
```
mvn clean test -Dfuzzing=true
```

## Examples
You can run the examples in the `com.intel.qat.examples`, use the below command:
```
java -cp .:./target/classes/ com.intel.qat.examples.<example-class>
```

Or using this command:
```
java --module-path target/classes  -m com.intel.qat/com.intel.qat.examples.<example-class>
```
