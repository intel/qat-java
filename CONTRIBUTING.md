# Contributing

## Issues

Here you'll find instructions on how to contribute to the QAT-Java Library.

Your contributions are most welcome!  You'll find it is best to begin
with a conversation about your changes, rather than just writing a bunch
of code and contributing it out of the blue.
A great way to suggest new features, offer to add a feature,
or just begin a dialog about the QAT-Java Library is to open an issue in our [GitHub Issues Database](https://github.com/intel/qat-java/issues)


### Contribution Guide

We accept contributions as pull requests on GitHub. Please follow these simple rules: 

* A PR should have a clear purpose, and do one thing only, and nothing more. This will enable us review your PR more quickly.
* Each commit in PR should be a small, atomic change representing one step in development.
* Please squash intermediate steps within PR for bugfixes, style cleanups, reversions, etc., so they would not appear in merged PR history.
* Please explain anything non-obvious from the code in comments, commit messages, or the PR description, as appropriate.

### Code formatting and check

Please check the formatting of the code by running:

```
mvn spotless:check
```

The code can be formatted with:
```
mvn spotless:apply
```
### License

Java* Native Interface binding for IntelÂ® Quick Assist Technology is licensed under the terms in [BSD](https://github.com/intel/qat-java/blob/main/LICENSE). By contributing to the project, you agree to the license and copyright terms therein and release your contribution under these terms.

### Sign your work

Please use the sign-off line at the end of the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:
